## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Yasmin Ramadan** — a data-driven problem solver with a growing focus on **Machine Learning and Data Science**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of data, logic, and real-world impact — from cleaning and exploring messy datasets to building predictive models and translating results into clear, actionable insights.

My approach is hands-on and practical:  
I learn by building, experimenting, and breaking things until they make sense.  
Currently, I’m deepening my understanding of machine learning algorithms, neural networks, and data visualization, while continuously developing real-world projects that reflect industry use cases.

I’m especially interested in roles where data is used to **support decisions, optimize systems, or uncover hidden patterns**.

## 🧠 How I Think

- I believe **good data > complex models**
- I focus on **understanding the problem before choosing the algorithm**
- I care about **interpretability as much as accuracy**
- I prefer building things that can actually be used, not just trained
